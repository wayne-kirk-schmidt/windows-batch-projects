Windows Batch Projects
======================
The Windows batch projects are to capture simple scripts that both 
teach windows batch details and scripting advice when dealing with batch.

But why Windows batch? It is the least common denominator to get things done.
For the a while it will still be something you can use to run tasks.

And, to be able to compare between other languages helps you understand 
them and the language you are trying to learn.

Installing the Scripts
=======================

The scripts are organized in directories, and run from them.
Output, Log files, Error files are saved in directories of your choosing from a config file.

Each project can be installed, and then editing the .cfg file to place your output.

script /help - generates a help message on how to use the script
script <configfile> - runs the script with a config
